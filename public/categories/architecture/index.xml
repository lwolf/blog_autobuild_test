      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s 4 months now since I migrated my infrastructure to CoreOS and Kubernetes. Now I can say that this was the right decision. Or, even, the best thing that happened to my servers :).
Of course, there were some problems during this period, but mostly because of some misconfiguration from my side. Also, there was no single downtime because of infrastructure.
My original post was very long and compicated. Actually, even I don&amp;rsquo;t want to reproduce all of this stuff ever again.</description>
